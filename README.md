🔥 GODOT OF BABEL 🔥
</h1>

<p align="center">
  <em>A growing collection of modular Godot scripts, systems, and implementations — built to be dropped into any project.</em>
</p>

## 🚧 Status: **Alpha Build**
> Expect frequent changes and rewrites as systems evolve.  
> Contributions and feedback are welcome!

---

## 🎯 Purpose
**Godot of Babel** is my personal library of **reusable gameplay systems** and **prototyping tools** for Godot 4+.  
The goal is to make building new projects faster, cleaner, and more consistent — a foundation you can keep expanding.
